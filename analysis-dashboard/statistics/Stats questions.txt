1. Assume the average weight of an American adult male is 180 pounds, with a standard deviation of 34 pounds. 
The distribution of weights follows a normal distribution. 
What is the probability that a man weighs exactly 185 pounds?

 When finding the probabilities using a continuous distribution, the probability of obtaining 
an exact value is zero. If the question had been what is the probability that a man's weight is between 184.99 and 
185.01, then the answer would be a small but positive value of 0.0002.

2. Assume the average weight of an American adult male is 180 pounds, with a standard deviation of 34 pounds. 
The distribution of weights follows a normal distribution. 
What is the probability that a man weighs somewhere between 120 and 155 pounds?

Correct! The area under this particular Gaussian distribution between 120 and 155 would be 0.19. 
The area under the Gaussian curve represents the probability.

3. Now, consider a binomial distribution. Assume that 15% of the population is allergic to cats. 
If you randomly select 60 people for a medical trial, what is the probability that 7 of those people are allergic to 
cats?
