## Introduction to Data Engineering

This repo documents my data engineering's learning journey, through different MOOCs, such as Udemy, Udacity, DataCamp, DataQuest, DataZoomCamp, TrendyTech (some of these
mentions are currently anticipatory).

The directories are arranged according to the different data engineering concepts and themes. There are accompanying `README` files for each of these directories to introduce their respective content.
