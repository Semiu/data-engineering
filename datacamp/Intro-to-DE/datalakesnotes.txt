Data Lakes

Data lakes stores all the raw data, as uploaded fron the different sources.
Stores all data structures. Cost effective but diffcult to analyze.
Requires an up-to-date data catalog
The data catalog is a source of truth that compensates for the lack of structure of the data. It records answers to
questions like What is the source of the data, where it is beig used, who is the owner of the data, and how often it is
updated. Good practice to have one in terms of data governance - it helps in managingg the availability, confidentiality,
and integrity.
Data catalog ensures reproducibility and avoids data lakes becoming data swamps. Serves as source of information for reliability,
autonomy, scalability and speed.
