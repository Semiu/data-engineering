Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse Solution
	Data warehousing requires a database. Amazon RDS is a cloud-based data warehousing solution that can be managed using SQL tools. 

	- Redshift Architecture: Redshift clusters - How they are organized into slices of compute
Redshift is a cluster machine. It has one leader node and 1 to n compute nodes. The leader node interacts with the outside world. But it cordinates the works of the compute nodes.
	
	- How is RedShift different from Relational DB - Row vs. Column
Redshift is a column-oriented RDBMS. It means: it is best suited for OLAP workloads. 
In traditional RDBMS, multiple queries are executed in parallel. Each query on a single CPU. This is suitable for OLTP applications.
For data warehousing solution which deals with massive data like Amazon Redshift. These are MPP - massively parallel processing. They execute one query on multiple CPUs 
in parallel - on multiple machines. Table is partitioned into small partitions and distributed into different CPUs.
