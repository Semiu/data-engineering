ETL - Loading after transformation.
This is the traditional approach in data warehousing because the data technologies are mostly on-premises. Data are usually extracted, then
transformed in the transformation engine in an intermediate server. Then, the data loaded to the target.
ETL handles limited, well-defined use cases well.

ELT - Loading before transformation, in Cloud environment. The data is loaded directly to the target. Then,
transformation is applied on demand. This happens on the destination server. This gives the opportunities 
of scaling, flexibility, cost shifting, better performance for large datasets, and more flexibile for NoSQL datasets.
