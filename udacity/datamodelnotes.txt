Data model: an abstraction that organizes data elements and how they relate to each other.Conceptual (entities mapping) to
logical (column definition, relationship for referential integrity) and physical (data definition and manipulation 
languages)

Advantages of using relational db
ease of use - SQL
ability to do JOINS, aggregations and analytics
secondary indexes - searching data on columns that are not the primary keys (though require additional resources)
queries flexibility
ACID transactions

When not to use relational db
* large amount of data
* to store different data type format
* can only scale vertically - not horizontally because they are not distributed
