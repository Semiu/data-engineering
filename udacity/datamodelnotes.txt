Data model: an abstraction that organizes data elements and how they relate to each other.Conceptual (entities mapping) to
logical (column definition, relationship for referential integrity) and physical (data definition and manipulation 
languages)

Advantages of using relational db
ease of use - SQL
ability to do JOINS, aggregations and analytics
secondary indexes - searching data on columns that are not the primary keys (though require additional resources)
queries flexibility
ACID transactions

When not to use relational db
* large amount of data
* to store different data type format
* can only scale vertically - not horizontally because they are not distributed

Non-relational DB
NoSQL db - simpler design, simpler horizontal scaling. Different data structures that make some operatins faster than 
what is obtainable in relational db.
Apache Cassandra is partition row store
MongoDB is Document store - asides from the key-value for data lookup, it offers API for query language
DynamiDb is Key-value store
Apache HBase is wide column store. Uses row and columns but, unlike in RDB, it allows different row format in the same 
table
Neo4J - graph database where entities are represented in nodes and the relationship in edges

Apache Cassandra
It provides scalability and high availability, proven fault tolerance, ths suitable for mission-critical data. It is CQL.
Cassandra Query Language

Keyspace - collection of tables
Table - a group of partitions
Rows - a single item
Partition - fundamental unit of access, collection of rows and how data is distributed
Primary key - made up of the partition key and clustering columns
Columns - clustering and data, labelled element
